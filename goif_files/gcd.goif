% gcd.goif
% This code calculates the greatest common denominator of two user-inputted numbers.
%
% args:
% 1 (Optional) - The first number
% 2 (Optional) - The second number
%
% Notes:
% This code is more basic than I expected because I wrote it before I wrote the language. The
%  first version of this program had the standard library as part of it which made it much
%  longer; therefore, this valid program is accompanied by the standard library at 
%  <https://github.com/chasehult/goif/blob/master/std.goif>.

GCD:
 %%%
 % This calculates the common denominator using Euclid's algorithm.
 % args:
 % 1: NUMBER - the first number 
 % 2: NUMBER - the second number 
 % 
 % returns:
 % 1: NUMBER - the greatest common denominator
